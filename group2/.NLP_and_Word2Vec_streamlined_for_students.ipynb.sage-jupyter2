collectively agreed to keep warming \"well under °c\".\nhowever, with pledges made under the agreement, global warming would still reach about .\n°c ( .\n°f) by the end of the century.\nlimiting warming to .\n°c will require halving emissions by and achieving net-zero emissions by .\nmaking deep cuts in emissions will require switching away from burning fossil fuels and towards using electricity generated from low-carbon sources.\nthis includes phasing out coal-fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, and other types of renewable energy, and taking measures to reduce energy use.\nelectricity will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.\ncarbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and by farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.\nwhile communities may adapt to climate change through efforts like better coastline protection, they cannot avert the risk of severe, widespread, and permanent impacts.\nbefore the s, it was unclear whether warming by increased greenhouse gases would dominate aerosol-induced cooling.\nscientists then often used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to the human impact on the climate.\nin the s, the terms global warming and climate change were popularised.\nthe former refers only to increased surface warming, the latter describes the full effect of greenhouse gases on the climate.\nglobal warming became the most popular term after nasa climate scientist james hansen used it in his testimony in the u.s. senate.\nin the s, the term climate change increased in popularity.\nglobal warming usually refers to human-induced warming of the earth system, whereas climate change can refer to natural or anthropogenic change.\nthe two terms are often used interchangeably.\nvarious scientists, politicians and media figures have adopted the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and global heating instead of global warming.\nthe policy editor-in-chief of the guardian said they included this language in their editorial guidelines \"to ensure that we are being scientifically precise, while also communicating clearly with readers on this very important issue\".\nin , oxford languages chose climate emergency as its word of the year, defining it as \"a situation in which urgent action is required to reduce or halt climate change and avoid potentially irreversible environmental damage resulting from it\".\nmultiple independent instrumental datasets show that the climate system is warming.\nthe – decade warmed to an average .\n°c [ .\n– .\n°c] compared to the pre-industrial baseline ( – ).\nsurface temperatures are rising by about .\n°c per decade, with reaching a temperature of .\n°c above the pre-industrial era.\nsince , the number of cold days and nights has decreased, and the number of warm days and nights has increased.\nthere was little net warming between the th century and the mid- th century.\nclimate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.\nthermometer records began to provide global coverage around .\nhistorical patterns of warming and cooling, like the medieval climate anomaly and the little ice age, did not occur at the same time across different regions.\ntemperatures may have reached as high as those of the late- th century in a limited set of regions.\nthere have been prehistorical episodes of global warming, such as the paleocene–eocene thermal maximum.\nhowever, the modern observed rise in temperature and co concentrations has been so rapid that even abrupt geophysical events in earth's history do not approach current rates.\nevidence of warming from air temperature measurements are reinforced with a wide range of other observations.\nthere has been an increase in the frequency and intensity of heavy precipitation, melting of snow and land ice, and increased atmospheric humidity.\nflora and fauna are also behaving in a manner consistent with warming; for instance, plants are flowering earlier in spring.\nanother key indicator is the cooling of the upper atmosphere, which demonstrates that greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the earth's surface and preventing it from radiating into space.\nregions of the world warm at differing rates.\nthe pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet.\nsince the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature.\nthis is because of the larger heat capacity of oceans, and because oceans lose more heat by evaporation.\nthe thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least , and over % of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean.\nthe rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.\nthe northern hemisphere and the north pole have warmed much faster than the south pole and southern hemisphere.\nthe northern hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice.\nas these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat.\nlocal black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to arctic warming.\narctic temperatures are increasing at over twice the rate of the rest of the world.\nmelting of glaciers and ice sheets in the arctic disrupts ocean circulation, including a weakened gulf stream, further changing the climate.\nthe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years (such as the el niño–southern oscillation), decades or even centuries.\nother changes are caused by an imbalance of energy that is \"external\" to the climate system, but not always external to the earth.\nexamples of external forcings include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the earth's orbit around the sun.\nto determine the human contribution to climate change, known internal climate variability and natural external forcings need to be ruled out.\na key approach is to determine unique \"fingerprints\" for all potential causes, then compare these fingerprints with observed patterns of climate change.\nfor example, solar forcing can be ruled out as a major cause.\nits fingerprint would be warming in the entire atmosphere.\nyet, only the lower atmosphere has warmed, consistent with greenhouse gas forcing.\nattribution of recent climate change shows that the main driver is elevated greenhouse gases, with aerosols having a dampening effect.\nthe earth absorbs sunlight, then radiates it as heat.\ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere absorb and reemit infrared radiation, slowing the rate at which it can pass through the atmosphere and escape into space.\nbefore the industrial revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about °c warmer than it would have been in their absence.\nwhile water vapour (~ %) and clouds (~ %) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they increase as a function of temperature and are therefore feedbacks.\non the other hand, concentrations of gases such as co (~ %), tropospheric ozone, cfcs and nitrous oxide are not temperature-dependent, and are therefore external forcings.\nhuman activity since the industrial revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance.\nin , the concentrations of co and methane had increased by about % and %, respectively, since .\nthese co levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last million years.\nconcentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last , years.\nglobal anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in were equivalent to billion tonnes of co . of these emissions, % was co , % was methane, % was nitrous oxide, and % was fluorinated gases.\nco emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity.\nadditional co emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the co released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertiliser.\nmethane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction.\nnitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser.\ndespite the contribution of deforestation to greenhouse gas emissions, the earth's land surface, particularly its forests, remain a significant carbon sink for co . natural processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, more than offset the greenhouse gas contributions from deforestation.\nthe land-surface sink is estimated to remove about % of annual global co emissions.\nthe ocean also serves as a significant carbon sink via a two-step process.\nfirst, co dissolves in the surface water.\nafterwards, the ocean's overturning circulation distributes it deep into the ocean's interior, where it accumulates over time as part of the carbon cycle.\nover the last two decades, the world's oceans have absorbed to % of emitted co . air pollution, in the form of aerosols, not only puts a large burden on human health, but also affects the climate on a large scale.\nfrom to , a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the earth's surface was observed, a phenomenon popularly known as global dimming, typically attributed to aerosols from biofuel and fossil fuel burning.\nglobally, aerosols have been declining since , meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.\naerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation.\nthey also have indirect effects on the earth's radiation budget.\nsulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets.\nthese clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets.\nthey also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight.\nindirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.\nwhile aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming.\nnot only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise.\nlimiting new black carbon deposits in the arctic could reduce global warming by .\n°c by .\nhumans change the earth's surface mainly to create more agricultural land.\ntoday, agriculture takes up % of earth's land area, while % is forests, and % is uninhabitable (glaciers, deserts, etc.).\nthe amount of forested land continues to decrease, which is the main land use change that causes global warming.\ndeforestation releases co contained in trees when they are destroyed, plus it prevents those trees from absorbing more co in the future.\nthe main causes of deforestation are: permanent land-use change from forest to agricultural land producing products such as beef and palm oil ( %), logging to produce forestry/forest products ( %), short term shifting cultivation ( %), and wildfires ( %).\nland use changes not only affect greenhouse gas emissions.\nthe type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature.\nit impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation.\nfor instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight.\ndeforestation can also affect temperatures by modifying the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns.\nin tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to a cooling effect.\nglobally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.\nphysical climate models are unable to reproduce the rapid warming observed in recent decades when taking into account only variations in solar output and volcanic activity.\nas the sun is the earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system.\nsolar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early s onwards.\nthere has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun's energy reaching the earth.\nfurther evidence for greenhouse gases causing global warming comes from measurements that show a warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere), coupled with a cooling of the upper atmosphere (the stratosphere).\nif solar variations were responsible for the observed warming, the troposphere and stratosphere would both warm.\nexplosive volcanic eruptions represent the largest natural forcing over the industrial era.\nwhen the eruption is sufficiently strong (with sulfur dioxide reaching the stratosphere), sunlight can be partially blocked for a couple of years.\nthe temperature signal lasts about twice as long.\nin the industrial era, volcanic activity has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends.\npresent-day volcanic co emissions are equivalent to less than % of current anthropogenic co emissions.\nthe response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by self-reinforcing feedbacks and reduced by balancing feedbacks.\nthe main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds.\nthe primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature.\nin addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of co on plant growth.\nuncertainty over feedbacks is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.\nas the air is warmed by greenhouse gases, it can hold more moisture.\nwater vapour is a potent greenhouse gas, so this further heats the atmosphere.\nif cloud cover increases, more sunlight will be reflected back into space, cooling the planet.\nif clouds become higher and thinner, they act as an insulator, reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet.\nthe effect of clouds is the largest source of feedback uncertainty.\nanother major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the arctic, which reduces the reflectivity of the earth's surface.\nmore of the sun's energy is now absorbed in these regions, contributing to amplification of arctic temperature changes.\narctic amplification is also melting permafrost, which releases methane and co into the atmosphere.\nclimate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands, marine systems, and freshwater systems.\noverall, climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive.\naround half of human-caused co emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans.\non land, elevated co and an extended growing season have stimulated plant growth.\nclimate change increases droughts and heat waves that inhibit plant growth, which makes it uncertain whether this carbon sink will continue to grow in the future.\nsoils contain large quantities of carbon and may release some when they heat up.\nas more co and heat are absorbed by the ocean, it acidifies, its circulation changes and phytoplankton takes up less carbon, decreasing the rate at which the ocean absorbs atmospheric carbon.\noverall, at higher co concentrations the earth will absorb a reduced fraction of our emissions.\na climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect the climate system.\nmodels are used to calculate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks.\nmodels also include natural processes like changes in the earth's orbit, historical changes in the sun's activity, and volcanic forcing.\nin addition to estimating future temperatures, they reproduce and predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.\nthe physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates.\npast models have underestimated the rate of arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase.\nsea level rise since was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations.\nthe united states-published national climate assessment notes that \"climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes\".\na subset of climate models add societal factors to a simple physical climate model.\nthese models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect – and interact with – the physical climate.\nwith this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions.\nthis is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change in the future.\ndepending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric co concentrations that range widely between and ppm.\nthe ipcc sixth assessment report projects that global warming is very likely to reach .\n°c to .\n°c by the late st century under the very low ghg emissions scenario.\nin an intermediate scenario global warming would reach .\n°c to .\n°c, and .\n°c to .\n°c under the very high ghg emissions scenario.\nthese projections are based on climate models in combination with observations.\nthe remaining carbon budget is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases.\naccording to the ipcc, global warming can be kept below .\n°c with a two-thirds chance if emissions after do not exceed or gigatonnes of co . this corresponds to to years of current emissions.\nthere are high uncertainties about the budget.\nfor instance, it may be gigatonnes of co smaller due to methane release from permafrost and wetlands.\nhowever, it is clear that fossil fuel resources are too abundant for shortages to be relied on to limit carbon emissions in the st century.\nthe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather.\nchanges may occur gradually or rapidly.\nevidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations.\nsince the s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously

increasing.\nfrequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.\nhowever, a study review article published in in nature geoscience concluded that the geographic range of tropical cyclones will probably expand poleward in response to climate warming of the hadley circulation.\nglobal sea level is rising as a consequence of glacial melt, melt of the ice sheets in greenland and antarctica, and thermal expansion.\nbetween and , the rise increased over time, averaging .\n± .\nmm per year.\nover the st century, the ipcc projects that in a very high emissions scenario the sea level could rise by – cm.\nincreased ocean warmth is undermining and threatening to unplug antarctic glacier outlets, risking a large melt of the ice sheet and the possibility of a -meter sea level rise by under high emissions.\nclimate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the arctic sea ice.\nwhile ice-free summers are expected to be rare at .\n°c degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of °c.\nhigher atmospheric co concentrations have led to changes in ocean chemistry.\nan increase in dissolved co is causing oceans to acidify.\nin addition, oxygen levels are decreasing as oxygen is less soluble in warmer water.\ndead zones in the ocean, regions with very little oxygen, are expanding too.\ngreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through ‘tipping points’—thresholds beyond which certain impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures are reduced.\nan example is the collapse of west antarctic and greenland ice sheets, where a temperature rise of .\nto °c may commit the ice sheets to melt, although the time scale of melt is uncertain and depends on future warming.\nsome large-scale changes could occur over a short time period, such as a shutdown of certain ocean currents like the atlantic meridional overturning circulation.\ntipping points can also include irreversible damage to ecosystems like the amazon rainforest and coral reefs.\nthe long-term effects of climate change include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, and ocean acidification.\non the timescale of centuries to millennia, the magnitude of climate change will be determined primarily by anthropogenic co emissions.\nthis is due to co 's long atmospheric lifetime.\noceanic co uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will continue for hundreds to thousands of years.\nthese emissions are estimated to have prolonged the current interglacial period by at least , years.\nsea level rise will continue over many centuries, with an estimated rise of .\nmetres per degree celsius ( .\nft/°f) after years.\nrecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes.\nhigher atmospheric co levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening.\nhowever, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions.\nthe future balance of these opposing effects is unclear.\nclimate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics.\nthe size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely.\noverall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many

to less than .\n°c with a high likelihood of success, global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by , or by with a °c target.\nthis requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry.\nthe united nations environment programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the paris agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to °c.\nan even greater level of reduction is required to meet the .\n°c goal.\nwith pledges made under the agreement as of october , global warming would still have a % chance of reaching about .\n°c (range: .\n– .\n°c) by the end of the century.\nalthough there is no single pathway to limit global warming to .\nor °c, most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions.\nto reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry, such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation.\nother approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk.\nscenarios that limit global warming to .\n°c typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the st century.\nthere are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts.\nsolar radiation management (srm) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions.\nhowever, srm would raise significant ethical and legal issues, and the risks are poorly understood.\nrenewable energy is key to limiting climate change.\nfossil fuels accounted for % of the world's energy in .\nthe remaining share was split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy).\nthat mix is projected to change significantly over the next years.\nsolar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations.\nrenewables represented % of all new electricity generation installed in , nearly all solar and wind.\nother forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply.\nhowever, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison.\nto achieve carbon neutrality by , renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to % or more by in some scenarios.\ninvestment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by .\nelectricity would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport.\nin transport, emissions can be reduced fast by a switch to electric vehicles.\npublic transport and active transport (cycling and walking) also produce less co . for shipping and flying, low-carbon fuels can be used to reduce emissions.\nheating would be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps.\nthere are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables.\nfor wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects.\nwind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability.\ntraditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low.\ngoing forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs.\nbioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security.\nthe growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around nuclear waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents.\nhydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns.\nlow-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change.\nit also has the near-term benefit of reducing air pollution deaths, which were estimated at million annually in .\nmeeting the paris agreement goals that limit warming to a °c increase could save about a million of those lives per year by , whereas limiting global warming to .\n°c could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty.\nreducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions.\nif less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development.\nit also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development.\nmajor increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy.\nseveral covid- related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.\nstrategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector.\nin transport, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles.\nindustrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes.\nin the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting.\nthe use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency.\nagriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand.\na set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from levels.\nthese include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.\non the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets.\neliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about / ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use.\nlivestock also occupy % of ice-free land area on earth and consume feed from the % of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation.\nsteel and cement production are responsible for about % of industrial co emissions.\nin these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing co emissions requires research into alternative chemistries.\nnatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of co beyond naturally occurring levels.\nreforestation and tree planting on non-forest lands are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns.\nfarmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments.\nrestoration/recreation of coastal wetlands and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter (blue carbon).\nwhen carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems.\nwhere energy production or co -intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste co , the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere.\nalthough its current use is limited in scale and expensive, carbon capture and storage (ccs) may be able to play a significant role in limiting co emissions by mid-century.\nthis technique, in combination with bio-energy (beccs) can result in net negative emissions: co is drawn from the atmosphere.\nit remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques, such as beccs, will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to .\n°c.\npolicy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals.\nadaptation is \"the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects\".\nwithout additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of \"severe, widespread and irreversible\" impacts.\nmore severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive.\nthe capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less.\nthe first two decades of the st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow.\nmany countries have implemented adaptation policies.\nhowever, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.\nadaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding and protection.\nif that fails, managed retreat may be needed.\nthere are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact.\navoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody.\nin agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate.\ninsurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes.\neducation, migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability.\necosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention.\nby increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions.\nspecies can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate.\nprotection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt.\nmany of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation.\nfor instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure.\ngiving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk.\nrestored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.\nthere are synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation.\nadaptation often offer short-term benefits, whereas mitigation has longer-term benefits.\nincreased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand.\ncompact urban development may lead to reduced emissions from transport and construction.\nat the same time, it may increase the urban heat island effect, leading to higher temperatures and increased exposure.\nincreased food productivity has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation.\ncountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions.\nthis raises questions about justice and fairness.\nclimate change is strongly linked to sustainable development.\nlimiting global warming makes it easier to achieve sustainable development goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities.\nthe connection is recognised in sustainable development goal which is to \"[t]ake urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts\".\nthe goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation.\nthe geopolitics of climate change is complex.\nit has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves.\nthis framing has been challenged.\nfor instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions.\nfurthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell.\na wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions.\nas of , carbon pricing covers about % of global greenhouse gas emissions.\ncarbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems.\ndirect global fossil fuel subsidies reached $ billion in , and $ .\ntrillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in.\nending these can cause a % reduction in global carbon emissions and a % reduction in air pollution deaths.\nsubsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead.\nmore direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry.\nseveral countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production.\npolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality.\nfor instance, wealthy nations responsible for the largest share of emissions would have to pay poorer countries to adapt.\nas the use of fossil fuels is reduced, jobs in the sector are being lost.\nto achieve a just transition, these people would need to be retrained for other jobs.\ncommunities with many fossil fuel workers would need additional investments.\nnearly all countries in the world are parties to the united nations framework convention on climate change (unfccc).\nthe goal of the unfccc is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system.\nas stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained.\nthe unfccc does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do.\nglobal emissions have risen since the unfccc was signed.\nits yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations.\nthe kyoto protocol extended the unfccc and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions.\nduring the negotiations, the g (representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to \"[take] the lead\" in reducing their emissions, since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nper-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs.\nthe copenhagen accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the g . associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below °c.\nthe accord set the goal of sending $ billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by , and proposed the founding of the green climate fund.\nas of [update], the fund has failed to reach its expected target, and risks a shrinkage in its funding.\nin all un countries negotiated the paris agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below .\n°c and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under .\n°c.\nthe agreement replaced the kyoto protocol.\nunlike kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the paris agreement.\ninstead, a set of procedures was made binding.\ncountries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years.\nthe paris agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported.\nas of october [update], states and the european union have signed the treaty and states and the eu have ratified or acceded to the agreement.\nthe montreal protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the kyoto protocol specifically designed to do so.\nthe kigali amendment to the montreal protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases.\nthis made the montreal protocol a stronger agreement against climate change.\nin , the united kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency.\nother countries and jurisdictions followed suit.\nthat same year, the european parliament declared a \"climate and environmental emergency\".\nthe european commission presented its european green deal with the goal of making the eu carbon-neutral by .\nmajor countries in asia have made similar pledges: south korea and japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by , and china by .\nin , the european commission released its “fit for ” legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the european market must be zero-emission vehicles from .\nwhile india has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country.\nas of , based on information from national climate plans, which represent % of the parties to the paris agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be .\n% lower compared to levels, below the % or % reduction goals to limit global warming to .\n°c or °c, respectively.\nthere is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities.\nas of , agreement in recent literature reached over %.\nno scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view.\nconsensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change.\nnational science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions.\nscientific discussion takes place in journal articles that are peer-reviewed.\nscientists assess these every few years in the intergovernmental panel on climate change reports.\nthe ipcc assessment report stated that it is \"unequivocal\" that climate change is caused by humans.\npublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the united states and has since spread to other countries, particularly canada and australia.\nthe actors behind climate change denial form a well-funded and relatively coordinated coalition of fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists.\nlike the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about scientific data and results.\nmany who deny, dismiss, or hold unwarranted doubt about the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change are labelled as \"climate change skeptics\", which several scientists have noted is a misnomer.\nthere are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change.\nmanufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes.\nstrategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions, and questioning the motives of individual scientists.\nan echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.\nclimate change came to international public attention in the late s. due to media coverage in the early s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion.\nin popular culture, the climate fiction movie the day after tomorrow ( ) and the al gore documentary an inconvenient truth ( ) focused on climate change.\nsignificant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change.\nmore highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat.\npartisan gaps also exist in many countries, and countries with high co emissions tend to be less concerned.\nviews on causes of climate change vary widely between countries.\nconcern has increased over time, to the point where in a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency.\nhigher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change.\nclimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change.\nthey can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities.\nprominent demonstrations include the school strike for climate.\nin this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since by skipping school on fridays, inspired by swedish teenager greta thunberg.\nmass civil disobedience actions by groups like extinction rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport.\nlitigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies.\nactivists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change.\nlawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage.\nin the s, joseph fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why earth's temperature was higher than the sun's energy alone could explain.\nearth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat.\nhowever, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat which warms the planet.\nin eunice newton foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide.\nshe concluded that \"an atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...\" starting in , john tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totalling % of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat.\nhowever, water vapour and some gases (in particular methane and carbon dioxide) absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat within the atmosphere.\ntyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages.\nsvante arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the co concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes.\nat the end of an ice age, warming from increased co levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a feedback loop.\nin , he published the first climate model of its kind, showing that halving of co levels could have produced the drop in temperature initiating the ice age.\narrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling co to be around – °c.\nother scientists were initially sceptical and believed the greenhouse effect to be saturated so that adding more co would make no difference.\nthey thought climate would be self-regulating.\nfrom onwards guy stewart callendar published evidence that climate was warming and co levels rising, but his calculations met the same objections.\nin the s, gilbert plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum.\nthis model predicted that increasing co levels would cause warming.\naround the same time, hans suess found evidence that co levels had been rising, and roger revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase.\nthe two scientists subsequently helped charles keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the \"keeling curve\".\nscientists alerted the public, and the dangers were highlighted at james hansen's congressional testimony.\nthe intergovernmental panel on climate change, set up in to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research.\nfourth assessment report fifth assessment report special report: global warming of .\n°c special report: climate change and land special report: the ocean and cryosphere in a changing
